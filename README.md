# EECE656-WSN-Project

Now, the main idea of the project is to have a network of sensors using a simple network protocol, like token ring or peer-to-peer, where the nodes send data to a baseStation for collection. A node running the BaseStation application will forward these messages to the PC using the serial communication. Finally, the Oscilloscope application is used to visualize sensor readings on the PC.
